# redgame
Redgame is a currently untitled game that i'm making to learn about making games from scratch (as 'from scratch' as js gets, anyway). Constructive criticism is welcomed.

online version available at https://nuesb.github.io/redgame/

# local installation
Installation should be fairly simple, just unzip the repo to a directory and open index.html.
